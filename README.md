#  Hangman Game (Python)

A simple **console-based Hangman game** built using Python.  
The game randomly selects a fruit name, and the player must guess it with a limited number of attempts.

---

##  How It Works
- A random fruit name is chosen at the start
- The word is hidden using underscores (`_`)
- The player enters guesses to reveal letters
- The game ends when the word is guessed or attempts run out

---

##  Features
- Chooses a random fruit name every game  
- Reveals correct letters as the player guesses  
- Limits attempts based on the word length  
- Allows replay without restarting the program
